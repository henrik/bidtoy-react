# Bid toy, React.js

Playing with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/). This toy app is for bidding on an auction, since I work for an auction site.

Only intended for learning and experimentation; not aiming for production quality. (But please do suggest improvements in case I wasn't aware of them.)

Also see [the Angular version](/henrik/bidtoy) (feature parity not guaranteed).

## TODO

- [ ] Split up with e.g. require.js
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Try <https://github.com/kalasjocke/react-coffee-elements>
